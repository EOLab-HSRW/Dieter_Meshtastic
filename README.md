## Meshtastic

Meshtastic is an open-source project that enables a decentralized mesh network using affordable LoRa modules. It allows users to communicate over long distances without the need for the internet or cellular networks.

### Technology

#### LoRa (Not LoRaWAN)
- **Long-range communication:** LoRa enables wireless data transmission over several kilometers with minimal power consumption.
- **No infrastructure required:** Unlike LoRaWAN, Meshtastic operates without centralized gateways or network providers.

#### Off-Grid Communication
- **Works without the internet or mobile networks.**
- **Ideal for remote locations, emergency situations, and outdoor adventures.**

#### 100% Open Source
- **Software and hardware are fully open-source.**
- **Community-driven development.**

#### Decentralized Network
- **No routers required.**
- **Each device acts as a node in the mesh.**
- **Messages are relayed across nodes for long-distance communication.**

#### Encryption & Security
- **AES encryption ensures secure communication.**
- **Only devices with the correct keys can read messages.**

#### Battery Life & Power Efficiency
- **Optimized for low power consumption.**
- **Long-lasting battery life depending on usage and device.**

#### Messaging
- **Send & receive messages between mesh points.**
- **No phone required for communication within the mesh.**

#### GPS-Based Functions (Optional)
- **Share location data.**
- **Track movements within the network.**

### Device Pairing & Connectivity
- **Radios can be paired with a single phone at a time.**
- **Each device is capable of connecting to only one user at a time.**
- **Supports multiple communication methods:**
  - Serial
  - Wi-Fi
  - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
  - Ethernet
- **Messages are broadcasted via radio.**
- **No direct receipt confirmation, messages can be resent up to 3 times.**
- **If the receiver already has the message, it is ignored; otherwise, it is rebroadcast.**
- **Hop Limit:**
  - Default is 1.
  - If hop limit is 0, the message is not rebroadcast.
- **Each message is broadcast only once.**
- **Radio buffer holds around 30 packets; older packets are replaced by new ones.**

### Frequency Bands

#### Europe (EU)
##### 433 MHz Band
- **Effective Radiated Power:** 10 dBm
- **Frequency Range:** 433-434 MHz
- **Default Frequency (after reset):** 433.875 MHz

### Routing Algorithm
- **Flood Routing:** Messages are broadcasted across the network.

### Test Report 
**Date:** Wednesday, May 14th, 2025  
**Location:** Stollen, Bad Ems

![Map](./Assets/map.png)

#### Overview

 The tests focused on:

- **Signal reliability and failover**
- **Penetration and underground communication**
- **Mesh forwarding behavior**
- **Maximum distance between nodes**

---

#### Test Setup

All nodes were identical, based on the **RAK4631 module (model 4003)** operating at **868 MHz**.  
Transmission power was configured to **+20 dBm**, using Meshtastic’s default LoRa parameters.

### Node Roles and Locations

![Measured Map](./Assets/mapMeasure.png)

- **Base Node**  
  - Connected via serial to a data logger  
  - Located next to the antenna at the **Weidtmann shaft**

- **Second Node**  
  - Positioned at the **entrance of Shaft 2**

- **Third Node (Test Node)**  
  - Used for different test scenarios:
    1. Inside Shaft 2, opposite the bridge (deep tunnel area)
    2. Entrance to the tunnel on **Von Ems Street**, directly opposite the Weidtmann shaft

---

#### Test Results

##### 1. Base Test – Without Repeater

- **Goal:** Check if direct communication is possible over full range
- **Distance:** ~575 meters (mostly line-of-sight)
- **RSSI:** ~**–126 dBm**  
- **SNR:** Very low or negative

> 🔴 **Result:** Unstable communication. Rare messages received, possibly due to signal artifacts. Not reliable for data transmission.

---

##### 2. Mesh Forwarding Test – With Repeater Node

- **Repeater Node Position:** Tunnel midpoint near Shaft 2 (~361 m from base)
- **Tunnel depth at repeater location:** ~15–18 meters
- **RSSI:** **–85 to –96 dBm**  
- **SNR:** **+2 to +5 dB**

> 🟢 **Result:** Reliable message forwarding with low latency. High communication stability with acceptable signal quality.

---

### Summary

| Test Case               | Distance (m) | Repeater | RSSI (dBm)   | Result                          |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Base to Tunnel Entrance | ~575         | ❌        | ~–126        | Unstable, likely false positive |
| With Repeater Node      | ~575 total   | ✅        | –85 to –96   | Stable, reliable communication  |

---

### Conclusion

- Direct LoRa communication over 575 m in this terrain is **unreliable without relaying**.
- A **single strategically placed node** significantly improves performance and reliability.
- Meshtastic is suitable for underground monitoring or sensor mesh networks with proper placement.


### Calculation of needed Battery Capacity

- **Node Voltage**: 3.3V  
- **Power Source**: 12V Battery  
- **Voltage Regulation**: Step-Down Buck Converter (assumed 85% efficiency)  
- **Device Mode**: Periodic wake-up + long sleep  

#### Profile

Active Current: I_active = 125.90 mA
Active Duration: t_active = 0.4832 seconds
Sleep Current: I_sleep = 12.85 mA
Sleep Duration: t_sleep = 1200 seconds (20 minutes)
Cycle Time: T_cycle = t_active + t_sleep
Battery Capacity: 4400 mAh (with 20% safety margin → usable = 3520 mAh)



#### Energy Used Per Cycle (in mAs)

$$ E (active) = I (active) × t (active) = 125.90 × 0.4832 = 60.85 mAs $$
$$ E (sleep) = I (sleep) × t (sleep) = 12.85 × 1200 = 15420.00 mAs $$
$$ E (total) = E (active) + E (sleep) = 15480.85 mAs $$

#### Average Current at 3.3V

$$ I (avg 3.3V) = E (total) / T (cycle) = 15480.85 / 1200.4832 ≈ 12.9 mA $$

#### Power Consumption at 3.3V

$$ P (3.3V) = V × I = 3.3 × 0.0129 = 0.0426 W $$


#### Current Draw from 12V Battery

Assuming 85% efficient step-down conversion:

$$ I (12V) = P (3.3V) / (12V × 0.85) = 0.0426 / 10.2 ≈ 4.18 mA $$



####  Runtime with Given Battery (3520 mAh usable)

$$ T (runtime) = 3520 mAh / 4.18 mA ≈ 841 hours ≈ 35 days $$


#### Required Capacity for 90-Day Operation

#### Target Duration

$$ T (target) = 90 days = 2160 hours $$

#### Required Capacity (without margin)

$$ C (raw) = I (12V) × T (target) = 4.18 mA × 2160 h = 9028.8 mAh $$


#### Final Capacity with 20% Safety Margin

$$ C (final) = C (raw) / 0.8 = 9028.8 / 0.8 ≈ 11286 mAh $$


**A 12V battery with at least 11.3Ah capacity** is needed to support the node for 90 days.
