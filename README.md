## Meshtastic

Meshtastic is an open-source project that enables a decentralized mesh network using affordable LoRa modules. It allows users to communicate over long distances without the need for the internet or cellular networks.

### Technology

#### LoRa (Not LoRaWAN)
- **Long-range communication:** LoRa enables wireless data transmission over several kilometers with minimal power consumption.
- **No infrastructure required:** Unlike LoRaWAN, Meshtastic operates without centralized gateways or network providers.

#### Off-Grid Communication
- **Works without the internet or mobile networks.**
- **Ideal for remote locations, emergency situations, and outdoor adventures.**

#### 100% Open Source
- **Software and hardware are fully open-source.**
- **Community-driven development.**

#### Decentralized Network
- **No routers required.**
- **Each device acts as a node in the mesh.**
- **Messages are relayed across nodes for long-distance communication.**

#### Encryption & Security
- **AES encryption ensures secure communication.**
- **Only devices with the correct keys can read messages.**

#### Battery Life & Power Efficiency
- **Optimized for low power consumption.**
- **Long-lasting battery life depending on usage and device.**

#### Messaging
- **Send & receive messages between mesh points.**
- **No phone required for communication within the mesh.**

#### GPS-Based Functions (Optional)
- **Share location data.**
- **Track movements within the network.**

### Device Pairing & Connectivity
- **Radios can be paired with a single phone at a time.**
- **Each device is capable of connecting to only one user at a time.**
- **Supports multiple communication methods:**
  - Serial
  - Wi-Fi
  - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
  - Ethernet
- **Messages are broadcasted via radio.**
- **No direct receipt confirmation, messages can be resent up to 3 times.**
- **If the receiver already has the message, it is ignored; otherwise, it is rebroadcast.**
- **Hop Limit:**
  - Default is 1.
  - If hop limit is 0, the message is not rebroadcast.
- **Each message is broadcast only once.**
- **Radio buffer holds around 30 packets; older packets are replaced by new ones.**

### Frequency Bands

#### Europe (EU)
##### 433 MHz Band
- **Effective Radiated Power:** 10 dBm
- **Frequency Range:** 433-434 MHz
- **Default Frequency (after reset):** 433.875 MHz
- **Mode:** Long Fast (4 slots)

##### 869 MHz Band
- **Effective Radiated Power:** 27 dBm
- **Frequency Range:** 869.40-869.65 MHz
- **Default Frequency (after reset):** 869.525 MHz
- **Mode:** Long Fast (1 slot)

#### Long Range Fast Mode
- **Alternative Name:** Long Fast
- **Data Rate:** 1.07 kbit/s
- **Spreading Factor:** 11
- **Symbols:** 2048
- **Coding Rate:** 4/5
- **Bandwidth:** 250 kHz
- **Link Budget:** 153 dB

### Routing Algorithm
- **Flood Routing:** Messages are broadcasted across the network.
- **Version 2 and above prefer devices that are further away for relays.**
- **Uses Protocol Buffers for data serialization.**
- **Mesh Packet & Sub Packet Types for structured data transmission.**

### LoRa Datagram Structure
- **16-byte Preamble**
- **LoRa Physical Header:**
  - Packet Length
  - Sync Word (Default for Meshtastic: `0x2B`)

#### Packet Content Structure
| Offset | Bytes | Type | Description |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0x00   | 4     | int  | Destination (unique node ID, format: `0xffffffff`, little-endian) |
| 0x04   | 4     | int  | Sender (unique node ID, format: `0xffffffff`, little-endian) |
| 0x08   | 4     | int  | Packet ID (unique identifier for each packet) |
| 0x0C   | 1     | bits | Flags (see table below) |
| 0x0D   | 1     | bits | Channel Hash (for decryption) |
| 0x0E   | 1     | byte | Next Hop (for relays) |
| 0x0F   | 1     | byte | Relay Node (current transmission) |
| 0x10   | max 237 | bytes | Packet Data (unused bytes are not transmitted) |

#### Packet Header Flags
| Index | Bits | Usage |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 0      | 3    | Hop Limit |
| 3      | 1    | Acknowledgment Request (Want ACK) |
| 4      | 1    | MQTT Transmission (Packet coming from MQTT) |
| 5      | 3    | Hop Start (Original hop limit) |
